A neural network is a computer system inspired by the way the human brain works. Instead of using fixed rules, it learns patterns from examples. You can think of it as a web of “artificial neurons” that are connected together. Each neuron takes in some information, does a simple calculation, and passes the result to the next layer of neurons. When enough of these layers are stacked, the network can recognize very complex patterns — like spotting faces in photos, translating languages, or predicting what you might want to watch next. In short, neural networks are powerful tools that learn by example and get better the more data they see.
