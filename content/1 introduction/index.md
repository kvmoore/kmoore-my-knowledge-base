Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are composed of layers of interconnected nodes, or “neurons,” that process data by applying mathematical transformations and passing the results forward through the network. By adjusting the strengths of these connections—known as weights—neural networks learn to approximate complex functions and identify patterns in data. This flexibility makes them powerful tools for solving a wide range of problems, from simple classification and regression to advanced applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. Neural networks form the foundation of deep learning, where stacking many layers allows models to capture increasingly abstract and high-level features.
