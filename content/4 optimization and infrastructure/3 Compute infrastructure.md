Compute infrastructure provides the hardware and software backbone needed for large-scale neural network training. Specialized accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs deliver the parallel processing required for deep learning workloads. Different forms of parallelism—data, model, and pipeline—help distribute workloads across multiple devices. Memory optimization techniques reduce bottlenecks, allowing deeper and more complex models to fit into limited hardware. Large-scale distributed training frameworks like Horovod and DeepSpeed further scale training across clusters, making it possible to train cutting-edge models on massive datasets efficiently.
