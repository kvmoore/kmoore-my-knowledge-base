title: Model Efficiency and Scaling
date: 2025-10-02
---

Model efficiency and scaling involve strategies that make neural networks faster, lighter, and more scalable while preserving accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning—through grid search, random search, or Bayesian methods—ensures the model is optimized for performance. Early stopping and pruning prevent wasted computation and reduce complexity by trimming unnecessary parameters. Compression methods such as quantization and knowledge distillation shrink model size for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Techniques like mixed precision training and gradient checkpointing enhance memory usage and computational speed, enabling larger models to be trained effectively.
