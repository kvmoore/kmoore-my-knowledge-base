Training optimization focuses on improving how neural networks learn during the training process. Core techniques include gradient descent variants such as SGD, Adam, and RMSProp, which update model weights efficiently. Learning rate schedules and adaptive optimizers further refine convergence speed and stability. Regularization methods like dropout, batch normalization, and weight decay help prevent overfitting, while data augmentation expands training sets with synthetic variations to improve generalization. Together, these approaches make training more stable, efficient, and robust
