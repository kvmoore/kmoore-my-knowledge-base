Convolutional neural networks introduce convolutional and pooling layers into the architecture to handle data with spatial structure. Instead of connecting every input neuron to every output neuron, CNNs use convolutional filters (kernels) that slide across the input to detect local patterns such as edges or textures. These local features are combined hierarchically across layers, enabling the network to recognize increasingly abstract patterns. Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions, lowering computational cost and adding translation invariance. Architecturally, CNNs balance parameter efficiency with representational power, making them the standard for vision-related tasks.
