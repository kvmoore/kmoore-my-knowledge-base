Currently based in Arlington Texas and working for a small robotics start up. I am from San Angelo Texas but have lived various places around the state. I am working on career pivot into software development, cloud computing and eventually machine learning and AI engineering. After graduating from and Aerospace college and during a long career in the aviation ,and space industry, I never stopped exploring new interests and hobbies. One of those interests was coding and software development. Over time, I discovered a genuine passion for it, which grew into the
desire to make a career pivot into the field. Although being a bit older and having a long career in my previous field, I feel I will be working many years to come in software development, cloud computing and machine Learning.

I finished a year-long Machine Learning and AI bootcamp in July, covering many complex concepts and several projects. I'm currently enrolled online and pursing an a bachelors in Computing Applications from Texas tech university. I am also studying python and essential skills related to related the field (Linux, CLI, Libraries, SQL, Algorithms..etc.) In addition, I have started studying for certifications and am working on portfolio projects.
