Containerization and orchestration enable consistent, scalable, and portable deployment of neural networks. Tools like Docker package models and their dependencies into lightweight containers that can run anywhere. At larger scales, Kubernetes orchestrates these containers across clusters, handling scheduling, scaling, and fault tolerance automatically. Helm charts and workflow automation further simplify deploying and managing complex machine learning workloads, ensuring that production systems remain reliable and adaptable to demand.
