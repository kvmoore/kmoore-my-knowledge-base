title: Monitoring and Observability

Monitoring and observability ensure that deployed models continue to perform as expected once in production. This involves logging predictions and tracking performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and error rates. Beyond system-level metrics, monitoring also includes detecting data drift and concept drift—when the input distribution or real-world patterns change over time—so models can be retrained before accuracy declines. Effective observability practices help maintain trust, reliability, and fairness in AI systems.
