CI/CD for machine learning brings automation and version control into the deployment lifecycle of neural networks. Automated testing and validation help verify that new models meet accuracy and performance requirements before being promoted to production. Version control ensures that both models and datasets are tracked, enabling reproducibility and rollback if needed. Continuous integration and deployment pipelines streamline the process of training, testing, and updating models, making machine learning workflows more efficient, scalable, and maintainable
