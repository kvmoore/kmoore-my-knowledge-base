## The Category 02 category index page

### What is this page?

This is an example category index page inside the knowledge base. This page is located within the `example-category-02` folder, which is located within the `content/` folder. 

On your local computer, this page corresponds to the file path: `content/example-category-02/index.md`.

### Naming a category page's index

Why is this page's file name `index` (`example-category-02/index.md`) instead of **Category 02**?

This file uses the `title` property/frontmatter to specify the category page title (e.g., `Category 02`). 

Any text added to a category folder's `index.md` file  will be used as the descriptive text for the category page.

A similar category is [[example-category-01/index | Category 01]], which also uses the `index.md` method to specify a category page title and descriptive text.
